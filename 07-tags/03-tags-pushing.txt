1. PUSHING INVIDIDUAL TAGS.

By default, git-push doesn't transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to
a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches -
you can run 'git push origin [tagname]'.

$ git push origin snapshot01
Password for 'https://rosrez@github.com': 
Counting objects: 1, done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 165 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git
 * [new tag]         snapshot01 -> snapshot01           <-- GIT DETECTED A NEW TAG THAT'S PUSHED UPSTREAM

Now, if we pull from that server into another repository, git also pulls the new tag:

$ git pull

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 137 (delta 28), reused 29 (delta 28), pack-reused 104

2. PUSHING ALL TAGS

Use the --tags option to git-push to push all tags to the remote server that are not already there.

$ git push --tags
Password for 'https://rosrez@github.com': 
Counting objects: 1, done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 161 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git
 * [new tag]         merge01 -> merge01                         <-- NEW TAG; PREVIOUSLY NOT ON SERVER
 * [new tag]         snapshot01-lw -> snapshot01-lw             <-- NEW TAG; PREVIOUSLY NOT ON SERVER

Now pull from another repository:

$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 1, done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), done.

 * [new tag]         snapshot01-lw -> snapshot01-lw             <-- NEW TAG; PREVIOUSLY NOT IN REPO
