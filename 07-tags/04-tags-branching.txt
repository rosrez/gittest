1. BRANCHING FROM A TAG.

If you want to put a version of your repository in your working directory that looks like a specific tag,
you can create a new branch at a specific tag with "git checkout -b [branchname] [tagname]":

$ git checkout -b branch-snap01 snapshot01
Switched to a new branch 'branch-snap01'
