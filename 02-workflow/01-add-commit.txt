git init testrepo

This creates the repository, i.e. the directory and a .git subdirectory in it.

git status 
----------

Git tracks contennt, not the filenames. For example, touch on a file doesn't change it status.

This displays status:
untracked - file has never been added.
new       - file that has just been added.
modified  - file already tracked,but modidied.
Reports the status of the repo no matter where in the directory structure you are.

git add index.html
------------------

git commit
-----------

Transfers contents of the staging area to the repo.

The command will open the default editor.
The text preceded by # on each line reminds you the filenames that are
currently in the staging area and are about to be committed.
You enter non-commented lines at the top of the file; only those lines
that were added are going to be saved in the history.
Exiting the editor without saving the changes will cancel the commit.

git commit -m 'Commit message'
------------------------------

Acts like git commit but doesn't open an editor since the message is provided.

git rm --cached <file>
----------------------

Removes the file from the staging area, so that it's not a committed at the next commit.

git add .
---------

Adds all untracked files from the current directory to a repo recursively (i.e. includes subdirs).
