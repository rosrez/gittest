Merges the current branch with its associated remote branch.

git merge remote/branch
-----------------------
Will merge the current branch with ANY REMOTE BRANCH.

EXAMPLE: RESOLVING A MERGE CONFLICT.

Suppose we made conflicting changes to a file in a branch called mediumfeature2 and in the mainline (master). We pushed mediumfeature2 to a shared remote repo and are now trying to merge mediumfeature2 into master.

1. We perform git-fetch:

$ git merge origin/mediumfeature2
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	conflict.txt
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Aborting

Git noticed the conflict, but our local changes are not saved anywhere (we haven't committed to master yet).

2. We do a git-commit:
