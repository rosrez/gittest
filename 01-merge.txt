git merge
---------
Merges the current branch with its associated remote branch.

git merge remote/branch
-----------------------
Will merge the current branch with ANY REMOTE BRANCH.

EXAMPLE: RESOLVING A MERGE CONFLICT.

Suppose we made conflicting changes to a file in a branch called mediumfeature2 and in the mainline (master). We pushed mediumfeature2 to a shared remote repo and are now trying to merge the changes.
