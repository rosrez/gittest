1. SHOWING BRANCH INFO

1) Basic info about local branches

$ git branch
  feature1
* master
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin

2) Info about all branches, including remote branches.

$ git branch -a
  feature1
* master
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature2
  remotes/origin/newidea

3) Seeing last commits on each branch:

$ git branch -v
  feature-fix1  9e5cee8 fixed extra stuff
  feature1      0a8efd9 feature1 change
  feature2      992d0c8 feature2 development
* master        6715c84 [ahead 7] Resolved feature-fix1 conflict
  mediumfeature 3b0699e [behind 2] Commit to branch created elsewhere
  newidea       13476de User 1 - 3rd idea
  origin        13476de User 1 - 3rd idea

4) Show branches that have been merged into the one we're currently on:

$ git branch --merged
  feature-fix1
  feature1
  feature2
* master

5) Show branches that have not been merged yet into the one we're on:

$ git branch --no-merged
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin

2. SHOWING INDIVIDUAL COMMITS WITH BRANCH INFO

IMPORTANT!
The basic git-log commant shows just the *current* branch's log history (including all work 
preceding this branch). That is, git-log just traverses the parent subtree. To display commits from
all branches, add --all switch.

1) Adding branch-related info about logs (--decorate)

git log --oneline --decorate

$ git log --oneline --decorate
0a8efd9 (HEAD -> feature1) feature1 change
a5f07c2 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Merge race condition
de9d409 Merge document housekeeping: changed location
53e3af9 Merged a conflicting change from mediumfeature

The --decorate switch adds extra branch-related info to the output that normally just contains commits.
Here, we can see that the last commit pertains to the 'feature1' branch, which is the current branch
pointed to by HEAD (HEAD -> feature1).

2) Adding more graph info to git-log (--all: commits from all branches, --graph: display a graph)

$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
* 0a8efd9 (feature1) feature1 change
* a5f07c2 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge race condition
* de9d409 Merge document housekeeping: changed location
*   53e3af9 Merged a conflicting change from mediumfeature
