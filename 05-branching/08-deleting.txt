1. DELETING BRANCHES WITH git-branch

Run this command to delete a branch:

git branch -d <branchname>, as in:

$ git branch -d feature1
Deleted branch feature1 (was 0a8efd9).

This may be used to prune branches we've already merged into the mainline.

2. DELETING UNMERGED BRANCHES

By default, deleting unmerged branches failes:

$ git branch -d feature1
Deleted branch feature1 (was 0a8efd9).

$ git branch -d newidea
error: The branch 'newidea' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D newidea'.

As the output suggests, it is possible to delete an unmerged branch with 'git branch -D'.
