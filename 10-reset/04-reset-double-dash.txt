1. THE -- IN GIT-RESET OR GIT-CHECKOUT: SEPARATES THE TREE FROM FILES

git-checkout [commit/branch] path/to/file

can confuse branches with paths, for example, if we have a file named "master",

$ git checkout master

will checkout the master branch instead of the master file. In order to tell Git
we want the master *file* from our current HEAD, we can do:

$ git checkout -- master

The -- states that what follows will be paths to files, not branch names.

The same is true for the git-reset command.
