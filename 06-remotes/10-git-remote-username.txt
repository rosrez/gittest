git remote set-url origin https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git

NOTE. Note the rosrez@ -> username part. This is used to indicate that we are going to need to do updates to the remote repo as well. An address without a username is considered read-only, which is enough for cloning/pulling the repo.
