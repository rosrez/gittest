git diff
--------

The command can be used to compare:

1) two branches;
2) any two commits;
3) remote branches/commits and local branches commits

EXAMPLES

1) If we use the form

git diff branch1 branch2, OR the equivalent
git diff branch1..branch2

then we compare heads of those branches. We can refer to arbitrary commits within those branches using the usual navigational shortcuts, ~ and ^:

git diff branch1^^^..branch2^

2) We can also refer to individual commits, tags, branches by their hashes.

3) If we commit local and remote branches we use the syntax:

git diff <branch> <remote>/<branch>; if remote is the default origin then it will look like this:

git diff branchname origin/branchname

One useful option to git-diff is --word-diff which displays not just different lines but individual words. Useful to track down changes like constants, strings, etc.
