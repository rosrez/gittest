1. WHAT DOES FETCH DO?

Suppose we pushed a new branch (public-branch1) to a remote. Our collaborators do not automatically get notified,
since their remote references point to the same commits as at the time the last network communication with the
server occurred (i.e. fetch, clone, etc. was performed). We can see this in a different environment once cloned
from the same remote:

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean

This means our origin/master *does not* reflect the latest state of the remote's master branch (we know another
person has committed to it). Collaborators will never know until they perform git-fetch from the remote.

If one of our collaborators fetches from the server, they will get a reference to where 
the server's version of "public-branch1" is under the remote branch origin/public-branch1:

$ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 49, done.
remote: Total 49 (delta 10), reused 10 (delta 10), pack-reused 39
Unpacking objects: 100% (49/49), done.

   de9d409..f953da9  master     -> origin/master
 * [new branch]      public-branch1 -> origin/public-branch1 <--- Git SPOTTED A NEW BRANCH ON THE REMOTE

Git has now created a remote-tracking branch with the name origin/public-branch1. The remote-tracking branch is 
just a pointer that corresponds to the state of the remote branch at the time of fetch.

IMPORTANT!
Git has also downloaded any commits the remote has that our local repository does not have.

IMPORTANT!
When you do a fetch that brings down new remote-tracking branches, you don't automatically have local, editable
copies of them. Thus, after git-fetch, we don't have the public-branch1 branch, we only have an origin/public-branch1
pointer that we can't modify. git-branch illustrates this state:

$ git branch -a
* master
  mediumfeature
  mediumfeature2
  newidea
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature2
  remotes/origin/newidea
  remotes/origin/public-branch1    <--- NOW WE HAVE A POINTER TO origin/public-branch1, BUT NO public-branch1 LOCALLY!
