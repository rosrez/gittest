1. PUSHING A BRANCH TO A REMOTE

Suppose we have a local branch 'public-branch1' and we'd like to make it public and upload to a remote.

$ git branch
  feature-fix1
  feature2
  master
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin
* public-branch1

We use git-push to do so:

[admin@localhost gittest]$ git push origin public-branch1

 * [new branch]      public-branch1 -> public-branch1   <---- INDICATES A NEW BRANCH UPLOADED TO REMOTE

2. OTHER FORMS OF PUSHING

The preceding example is a shortcut. Git expands the public-branch1 name out to
refs/heads/public-branch1:refs/heads/public-branch1, which means, "Take my public-branch1" local branch
and push it to update the remote's "public-branch1" branch.

You can also do:

git push origin public-branch1:public-branch1,

which does the same thing, i.e. it says, "Take my public-branch1" and make it the remote's "public-branch1".
We can use this format to push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently, like so:

git push origin public-branch1:newbranch
                     ^            ^
                     |            |
               LOCAL NAME   REMOTE NAME
