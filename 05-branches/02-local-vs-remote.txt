1. SINCE ALL REPOSITORIES ARE EQUAL, CREATING A NEW BRANCH DOESN'T PROPAGATE IT TO ANY REMOTE REPOSITORY.

Suppose we have a newly created branched named 'feature1'. It will be visible locally, but won't be
included in any remote repositories.

1) To list branches, use git-branch without arguments. This displays a list of local
branches only:

[admin@localhost gittest]$ git branch
  feature1
* master
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin

We can see that our feature1 branch has appeared on the list of branches.

Creating a branch, however, does not automatically propagate it to remote repositories.
We can ussue the following command to check this.

2) Show all branches (including remote ones):

[admin@localhost gittest]$ git branch -a
  feature1
* master
  mediumfeature
  newidea
  origin
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature
  remotes/origin/mediumfeature2
  remotes/origin/newidea

As we can see, 'feature1' does not appear on the remote branch list yet. We need an explicit git-push
to push it to a remote repository of our choice.
