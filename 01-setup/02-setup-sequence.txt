EXAMPLE: CREATE A REPOSITORY
----------------------------

1. cd to a directory (populated or not).

2. (OPTIONAL) If not populated, make a README.md file (for github) or whatever other file.

3. git add all the files you have (existing files) or the one you've just created.

git add .

from the top directory will do for both cases.

4. Commit.

5. Set up a remote. When setting a writeable remote, make sure you provide your username, that is, use:

https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/net-stevens.git instead of
        ^^^^^^^

https://github.com/rosrez/net-stevens.git

The latter is automatically suggested by github, but this will only work to pull/fetch from the repository, not to push local updates to it.

So, use this type of command:

git remote add origin https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/net-stevens.git

6. Push to the remote repository. Use the -u option to set the upstream linkage at the same time unless it's a one-time push.

git push -u origin master
