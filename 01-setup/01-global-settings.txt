The bare minimum global setttings:

$ git config --global user.name "Oleg Rosowiecki"
$ git config --global user.email "rosrez@o2.pl"
$ 
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"

Optionally, you can create an SSH key pair to access your repo via SSH.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C"rosrez@o2.pl"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa):  
Created directory '/home/admin/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
....

-C just takes a comment and can be whatever we need, but it's common practice to use your e-mail address.
