1. CHANGING THE LAST COMMIT

IMPORTANT!
Modifying commits acts a a rebase, i.e. it changes commit history along with hashes etc.
This technique should be used only for *local* branches. Once a branch has been pushed
to a remote, modifying commit history must not be used.

Use git commit --amend to modify your last commit. See the example below.

1) Make a change

$ vi test/amend.txt

2) Commit it

$ git add test/amend.txt 
$ git commit -m 'commit to be amended'
[master fa98694] commit to be amended
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 test/amend.txt

3) See the history of most recent commits

$ git log -2 --pretty=oneline
fa986945e1f03cd1484057978df05f37e493c3e8 commit to be amended   <--- NOTE THE SHA-1 HASH
4d71f48a47fb8cd4d1eca3b4360fdee48c1fc348 moved text files to test folder

4) Now, if you forgot a few changes to existing files or forgot to add/remove files,
you need to simply add your changes to the staging area first:

$ git add test/amend*.txt

5) Then you have to run:

git commit --amend

This will open a text editor with the following text:

commit to be amended                    <--- THIS IS THE LAST COMMIT MESSAGE, WE CAN EDIT IT

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Thu Apr 28 08:47:14 2016 +0200
#
# On branch master
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   test/amend.txt
#       new file:   test/amend2.txt

We can edit the last commit message at this point to, say, 'amended last commit'. When we save the file
and exit the editor, we see the following:

[master 68b3255] amended last commit
 Date: Thu Apr 28 08:47:14 2016 +0200
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 test/amend.txt
 create mode 100644 test/amend2.txt

6) Now, the commit history looks like this:

$ git log --pretty=oneline -2
68b3255000855d29784e5dd701d75ed066fa21da amended last commit  <--- THE SHA-1 HASH HAS CHANGED!
4d71f48a47fb8cd4d1eca3b4360fdee48c1fc348 moved text files to test folder

7) When we inspect the last commit, we see that it now includes both the original change and
the additional modifications we made during the amend process.

$ git diff 4d71f48
