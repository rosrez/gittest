1. HOW ARE REFS EXPANDED?

When we specify a branch name in a command like git-log, it first expands the name to its full ref, so

$ git log --pretty=oneline -1 master
564848851cc692274ea86a71c9b83a9368889410 objects: object database

is equivalent to:

$  git log --pretty=oneline -1 refs/heads/master
564848851cc692274ea86a71c9b83a9368889410 objects: object database

Specifying a full branch ref is necessary, e.g. when there is a branch and a tag with identical names;
only the full ref can disambiguate between the tag and the branch (refs/heads clearly contains branches, not tags).
