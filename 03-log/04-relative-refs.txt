1. GIT LOG/SHOW WITH RELATIVE REFS

You can use relative refs such as HEAD~2 or HEAD^2^ as arguments to git-show/git-log.

For example:

# Only list commits that are parent of the second parent of a merge commit
$ git log HEAD^2

# Remove the last 3 commits from the current branch
$ git reset HEAD~3

# Interactively rebase the last 3 commits on the current branch
git rebase -i HEAD~3
