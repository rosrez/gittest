1. TRIPLE-DOT - SHOW ALL COMMITS SINCE COMMON ANCESTOR

With the triple dot notation, we can combine "commit2-commit1" and "commit1-commit2" differences in a single output:

$ git log --pretty=oneline master...compare2
cebc7a3f920d348b9c4360d685cbeb7eb384eb3b mainline change 4
03efd4717274d75ea253e2dcef9f369b92a34454 mainline change 3
1f0ab8f092713ef61e9d79a67118f3ba32cc2d7a added feature2.extra3

The order of the arguments to triple dot becomes irrelevant, so swapping the commits produces the same output:

$ git log --pretty=oneline compare2...master
cebc7a3f920d348b9c4360d685cbeb7eb384eb3b mainline change 4
03efd4717274d75ea253e2dcef9f369b92a34454 mainline change 3

5. GIT-DIFF ALSO SUPPORTS TRIPLE DOT

It is possible to supply triple dot to git-diff. The output is pretty much reverse to git-log:

1) Triple dot - compare2...master:

$ git diff compare2...master
diff --git a/test/mainline.txt b/test/mainline.txt
index 1362a1f..43f74f5 100644
--- a/test/mainline.txt

 diff change 1
 diff change 2
 MAINLINE CHANGE 2
+MAINLINE CHANGE 3
+MAINLINE CHANGE 4

Only shows changes in "master" that are not in "compare2".

2) Reverse the order of commit arguments:

$ git diff master...compare2
diff --git a/test/feature2.txt b/test/feature2.txt
index b5a9226..a148abd 100644
