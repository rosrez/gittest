1. SPECIAL REFS (.git DIRECTORY)

In addition to the refs directory, there are a few special refs that reside in the top-level .git directory. 
They are listed below:
•   HEAD – The currently checked-out commit/branch.
•   FETCH_HEAD – The most recently fetched branch from a remote repo.
•   ORIG_HEAD – A backup reference to HEAD before drastic changes to it.
•   MERGE_HEAD – The commit(s) that you’re merging into the current branch with git merge.
•   CHERRY_PICK_HEAD – The commit that you’re cherry-picking.
