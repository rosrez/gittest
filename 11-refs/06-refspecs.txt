1. WHAT IS A REFSPEC?

A refspec maps a branch in the local repository to a branch in the remote repository. It makes it possible to
manage remote branches using local Git commands and to configure some advanced git-push and git-fetch behaviour.

A refspec is specified as [+]<src>:<dst>. The <src> parameter is the source branch in the local repository, and
the <dst> parameter is the destination branch in the remote repository. The optional + sign is for forcing the
remote repository to perform a non-fast-forward update.

2. PUSHING A BRANCH UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME

Refspecs can be used with the git-push command to give a different name to the remote branch. For example,
the following command pushes the 'master' branch to the 'origin' remote repo like an ordinary git-push, but it
uses 'qa-master' as the name for the branch in the 'origin' repo.

$ git push origin master:refs/heads/qa-master

3. USING REFSPECS FOR DELETING REMOTE BRANCHES

This is occasionally useful if a feature branch was pushed to a remote repo and subsequently deleted in the local
repository. In order to prevent build-up of dead feature branches in the remote repo after they are deleted from
the local repo, you can delete them by pushing a refspec that has an empty <src> parameter:

$ git push origin :branchname

NOTE: A newer syntax is available for this operation:

$ git push origin --delete branchname

4. REFSPECS AND FETCHES

By default, the .git/config file contains a section like this:

[remote "origin"]
    url = https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

The 'fetch' line tells git-fetch to download all of the branches from the 'origin' repo. But, some workflows 
don't need all of them. To fetch only the 'master' branch, change the 'fetch' line to match the following:

[remote "origin"]
    url = https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master

You can also configure git-push in a similar manner. For instance, if you want to alwasy push the 'master' branch
to 'qa-master' in the 'origin' remote (as we did above), you would change the config file to:

[remote "origin"]
    url = https://rosrez@github.com/rosrez/gittest.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
    push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa-master

Refspecs give you complete control over how various Git commands transfer branches between repositories. They
let you rename and delete branches from your local repository, fetch/push to branches with different names,
and configure git-push and git-fetch to work with only the branches that you want.
